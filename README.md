# Steps for run the automate suite

**Notes**
For this exercise I used Pycharm as IDE, Pytest as Test Runner and Python as Language

If you don't have PyCharm please download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

First you must install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you do not have it already, after is installed you must validate in you cmd or in your terminal inside PyCharm you can run python and pip command if pip is not working please see this [tutorial](https://appuals.com/fix-pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/)

After both commands start working, you need to install the virtual enviroment in order to make things works, go to 
python -m venv env
